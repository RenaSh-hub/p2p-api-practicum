name: api-schema-validation
description: "Checks that API responses match the shapes in /openapi.json, through one helper, expectSchema. Use when writing or reviewing an API test, when the user asks to validate a response, check a schema, a contract, field types or required fields, or when a response has a field nobody expected. Do NOT use to decide which cases to test — that is api-test-design."
paths: "tests/**"

1. Find the schema name in /openapi.json (the response's $ref under paths → responses); never guess it. Rejected requests use Error.
2. Call expectSchema on every response body, success and error.
3. A schema check proves the shape, not the business: still assert the values that matter (status, rule, amounts, flags).
4. When a check fails, show the Ajv errors and ask the human whether the API or the docs are wrong. Never edit the schema or loosen the check to make it pass.
